This is an example project (HelloWorld) and two UIAutomation tests wrapped up by the jasmine BDD style.
In order to run the tests you need to point UIAutomation instrument to the suite.js file from the JasmineStyleUIAutomationTests folder.
You should see two passing tests in the log.

Pivotal (https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-iphone) is the original author of all the scripts from 
the JasmineStyleUIAutomationTests folder. I only modified them and I added HelloWorld-spec.js for demonstration.
Jasmine is include as a submodule so do not forget to do:

git submodule update --init
 
I could not make the original pivotal code working with Xcode 4.2 DP 3. 
I observed that the import functionality in UIAutomation instrument does not meet pivotal expectations.
Therefore I've changed slightly their files. I tested it with Xcode 4.2 DP 2 and 3.

The newest version of jasmine introduces 'exports'. It seems that UIAutomation instrument does not like that. 
To fix the problem I declare the 'window' variable in jasmine-uiautomation.js. 
Without it, Jasmine thinks that 'window' is 'undefined' and do will use 'exports'.
