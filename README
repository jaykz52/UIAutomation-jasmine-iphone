This is an example project (HelloWorld) and two UIAutomation tests wrapped up by the jasmine BDD style.
In order to run the tests you need to point UIAutomation instrument to the suite.js file.
You should see two passing tests in the log.

Notice that pivotal provides the original version of the jasmin support for UIAutomation in Instruments. However, I could not make their code working
with Xcode 4.2 DP 3. I observed that the import functionality in UIAutomation instrument does not meet pivotal expectations.
Therefore I've changed slightly their files.

Also notice that I declare the window variable in jasmine-uiautomation.js. Without it, Jasmine will think that window is undefined and will
use exports. It seems that UIAutomation instrument does not like that.
